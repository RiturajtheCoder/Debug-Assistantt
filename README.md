Python Screening Task 2 — AI Debugging Assistant Prompt
📌 Task Objective

This project is my submission for Python Screening Task 2: Write a Prompt for an AI Debugging Assistant.

The goal is to design a natural-language prompt that will guide an AI assistant to:

Analyze a student’s buggy Python code

Offer helpful suggestions or hints

Avoid revealing the correct solution

💬 The Prompt

Prompt to give the AI assistant:

You are a supportive Python debugging assistant helping a student. The student will give you their buggy Python code.
Your task is to:

Carefully read and analyze the code.

Point out possible logic errors, syntax mistakes, or missing parts.

Explain what might be going wrong and why.

Give helpful hints and guiding questions to lead the student toward fixing the issue themselves.

Do not write or reveal the full corrected code.
Do not give the exact solution.
Instead, help the student understand how to approach debugging step by step.

Be encouraging, clear, and beginner-friendly in your responses.

💡 Reasoning
🎯 Why I worded it this way

Clearly told the AI its role (“supportive Python debugging assistant”) to set the tone.

Listed specific tasks (analyze → find possible errors → explain → hint), which keeps the feedback structured and focused.

Explicitly told it to avoid providing the full solution, preventing answer dumping.

Emphasized giving guiding questions so the student thinks and learns.

🧠 How this avoids giving the solution

The prompt forbids giving the corrected code.

It only allows hints, error identification, and reasoning, which forces the AI to guide, not solve.

This ensures the student learns debugging skills, not just copies an answer.

👩‍🏫 How it encourages student-friendly feedback

Uses words like “supportive” and “encouraging” to set a positive tone.

Requires clear explanations, which builds understanding.

Suggests step-by-step guidance instead of overwhelming the student.

⚖️ Balancing identifying bugs vs. guiding the student

The AI first identifies likely issues, which gives the student a direction.

Then it asks questions or gives hints, encouraging the student to do the fixing themselves.

🧩 Adapting for different learners

Beginners: The AI can give simpler hints, more explanation, and small steps.

Advanced learners: The AI can give more abstract hints, focus on logic rather than syntax, and encourage using debugging tools or documentation.
